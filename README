[2011-11-03] Bucket list:
	2- add Akiva's visualization
	1- track trades (both offers + executed) and infer player preferences			-Chris
		- do preferences age?
		- how does this inform our trading strategy?
	1- states																		-Najaf
		- unknown preferences (starting game)
		- relevant trading (others want our offers and/or we want theirs)
			- different trading states
				- 
		- end-game
	2- eating strategy:																-Najaf
		- state-dependent
	2- when to trade for skittles that we have very few of? (heuristics)
		- vs having zero of it [significant if n_skittles >> n_players ?]
	1- some heuristics:																-Afreen
		- small trades vs. big trades?
		 	- 3 4 5 
		 	- is there a short window of opportunity for trades?
		 	- problem with Tao's halving strategy: 
		 		- after log(n) turns we find out we've chosen a bad color combo
		 		- with a small offer, we find out in only 1 turn
		 		-> alternative: start w/small offer and grow it logarithmically

	1- offer strategy																-Chris
		- aggregate trade accounting (*)
			- know preferences
			-> make offers are biased towards us, but which they'll still accept
